"""
Strip blocklisted-host items from pulse JSON files in-place.

The upstream ZH aggregator (SuYxh/ai-news-aggregator) wraps a lot of
individual KOL X/Twitter posts as "news" items — roughly 8% of the 7d
window. They're editorial / promotional rather than reporting, so we drop
them at refresh time. This runs in the GHA workflow after curl-ing the
upstream JSON and again from build_en_pulse.py for symmetry.

Schema-aware: rewrites `total_items` and `items`, leaves the rest of the
payload (site_stats, archive_total, etc.) untouched.
